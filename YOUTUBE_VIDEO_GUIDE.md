• Built in 1 day
• 100% vanilla (no frameworks)
• 14 git commits

💡 WHY I BUILT THIS:
The hackathon question hit different: "What would you ship if the internet was ending tomorrow?" Not another todo app or AI wrapper - something raw, emotional, and beautifully broken. A digital graveyard where last words live forever in LocalStorage.

🎨 FEATURES BREAKDOWN:
0:00 - Intro & Demo
0:30 - Homepage Tour (Countdown, Stats)
1:00 - Adding Messages (5 Types)
1:30 - Reactions System

6:00 - Final Thoughts

📚 WHAT I LEARNED:
• Pure vanilla JS is powerful
• LocalStorage is underrated
• CSS animations can be beautiful AND disturbing
• Constraints breed creativity
• Best features feel broken but aren't
• Apocalypse UIs hit different at 3 AM

🚀 WHAT'S NEXT:
• Backend with real-time sync
• Message expiration after countdown
• AI-generated apocalypse responses
• Mobile app version
• Global message map
